# GRC Engineering Labs

This repository documents my hands-on work in translating security governance,
risk, and compliance requirements into enforceable technical controls.

The focus is on:
- Policy-as-Code
- Control enforcement using Rego and Conftest
- Infrastructure risk prevention
- Mapping compliance frameworks (e.g. NIST 800-53) to real technical implementations
- Shifting GRC left into CI/CD and engineering workflows

## Why this repository exists

Traditional GRC often stops at documentation and audits.
This repo explores how governance can be **engineered**, automated,
and embedded directly into platforms and pipelines.

## Scope

- AWS security guardrails (S3, Security Groups, IAM)
- Identity governance and MFA enforcement
- Control-to-implementation mapping
- CI/CD policy enforcement concepts

## Disclaimer & Attribution

Some labs are adapted from publicly available educational resources
(e.g. the GRC Playground project) and are used here strictly for learning
and demonstration purposes, with attribution provided.

The value in this repository is in:
- My implementation
- My interpretation
- My documentation
- My control mappings and design decisions
