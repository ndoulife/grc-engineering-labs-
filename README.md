# GRC Engineering Labs

This repository documents my hands-on work in translating security governance,
risk, and compliance requirements into enforceable technical controls.

The focus is on:
- Policy-as-Code
- Control enforcement using Rego and Conftest
- Infrastructure risk prevention
- Mapping compliance frameworks (e.g. NIST 800-53) to real technical implementations
- Shifting GRC left into CI/CD and engineering workflows

## Why this repository exists

Traditional GRC often stops at documentation and audits.
This repo explores how governance can be **engineered**, automated,
and embedded directly into platforms and pipelines.

## Scope

- AWS security guardrails (S3, Security Groups, IAM)
- Identity governance and MFA enforcement
- Control-to-implementation mapping
- CI/CD policy enforcement concepts
